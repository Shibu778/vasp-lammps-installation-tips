# Installing OpenMPI, VASP, LAMMPS, QE, Siesta, etc on Ubuntu systems
Installation steps for various programs like VASP, LAMMPS, Quantum Espresso, Siesta, etc for Computational Materials studies (These are personal notes taken across 2 years). All steps are put in the Wiki https://github.com/shreeja7/vasp-installation-etc/wiki

My system build:
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Intel compilers from Intel Parallel XE Studio 2017.0.035 (student version)- Also works for v2019
